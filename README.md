## Frontend

The fronend is done in Next.js with TS and Tailwind. I chose Next.js to take advantage of server-side componets and it's built-in routing mechanism. Next.js seems like the proper tool to use for this project given its complexity.

## API

The backend api directory contains our api layer which I did in .NET for all the backend operation including interactions with Azure services. I understand that Next.js is a fullstack framework that accomodates for backend implementations, I chose to go with creating an api layer for the sake of security. Most of the subreddits I've read consist of people who use this exact structure.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure directory contains Terraform code to configure my Azure infrastructure. I am most familiar with Terrraform hence why I chose it over Bicep, and I would like to automate the configuration of my Azure infrastructure.

## DevOps (CI/CD)

For my CI/CD process I will be using Azure DevOps, I chose Azure DevOps over GitHub actions for the sole purpose of learning a new DevOps tool.
